# Spotify Merge Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
We are building a full-stack project called "Spotify Merge" using Next.js (frontend) and NestJS (backend), both in TypeScript.

**Goal**: Connect to Spotify via OAuth2, select multiple playlists, and automatically merge them into a single "global playlist" that updates every hour, adding only new songs.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript
- **Backend**: NestJS + spotify-web-api-node + @nestjs/schedule (for cron)
- **API**: Spotify API for authentication and playlist management
- **UI**: Minimal design with functionality focus

## Development Phases
The project progresses through 7 phases:
1. **Setup**: Environement Setup & Configuration
2. **Authentication**: Spotify OAuth2 Authentication
3. **Playlist Retrieval**: Playlist Retrieval
4. **Merging**: Playlist Merge Logic
5. **Automation**: Automation with Cron
6. **Cleanup**: Polish & Best Practices
7. **Deployment**: Deployment

## Code Organization
- **Frontend**: Located in `/frontend` directory
- **Backend**: Located in `/backend` directory
- **Shared**: Common types and utilities in `/shared` directory
- **Documentation**: Project docs in `/docs` directory

## Key Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between frontend and backend logic
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript usage across the stack
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for Spotify API interactions
- **Security**: Secure OAuth2 implementation and token management
- **Performance**: Efficient playlist merging and API usage
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented, and modular code

## File Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `PlaylistSelector.tsx`)
- Pages: kebab-case (e.g., `playlist-merge.tsx`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `spotifyApi.ts`)
- Types: PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., `SpotifyPlaylist.ts`)

## API Integration
- Use spotify-web-api-node for backend Spotify integration
- Implement proper token refresh mechanisms
- Handle rate limiting and API errors gracefully
- Cache playlist data when appropriate

## State Management
- Use Zustand for global state management
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Cache Spotify data to reduce API calls
- Handle loading and error states consistently

## Security Considerations
- Store sensitive data (tokens) securely
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for configuration
